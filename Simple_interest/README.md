Motivation: 
We have come up with this test case to calculate a simple interest.

Theory: 
Simple interest is a quick and easy method of calculating the interest charge on a loan. Simple interest is determined by multiplying the annual interest rate by the principal by the number of years.

formula: 
Simple Interest = (Principal * annual Interest rate(in %) * Number of year) / 100

Roadmap: 
1. create a header file(test file) and created a class in it. 
2. add private members for principal, interest rate and year. 
3. create a method which will set the private members and will calculate simple interest.
this method will takes 3 arguments and it will calculate the simple interest and return it as float point type.
4. create the main file in which we will test our code using assert function.
