Test Cases

1. no arguments passed: return a new line character.
2. single argument (foo): will print the argument in a new line.
3. multiple argument(foo bar): will print all the arguments in a single line.
4. argument in "foo bar": will consider a single argument

Test Strategies

1. We are reimplementing echo command in C++ programming and it behaves as like Linux command .
2. We are implementing this echo command for printing text as it is.
